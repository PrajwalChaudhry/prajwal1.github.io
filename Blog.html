				<p>We hope the blogs and resources above will help you live a better, healthier lifestyle. A lot of that boils down to understanding the environment you’re in. This includes the air you breathe, the water you drink, and the food you eat. It is one of the most important aspects of staying healthy and fit.<br><br>

				At Kaiterra, we believe in knowing what we breathe. We want to help everyone breathe better by writing about the latest updates and facts about indoor and outdoor air quality. Air quality monitoring is important to us because we know that without measuring things that negatively impact our health, it is hard to make meaningful and effective improvements. We make products to help us identify the pollutants in our air, which in turn helps you in creating a healthy home environment.</p>
